# GoodEats

Goodeats was formerly known as Revature which is a project I built while learning react in Codecademy. I figured I renamed the project something different. I also Added a different styling to the project. I had also encounter a problem with the initial build of the project. Since the yelp api does not support cors. The initital work around with this was by using cors-anywhere,but since the project was no longer being maintain then it stopped working. I took it upon my self to learn a bit of the backend and wrote a script and made the call to the yelp api on the backend. I hosted my backend in heroku and just had my front end make the call to the endpoint.
